AI:
AI is about making machines think and act like humans. It's like teaching a computer to solve problems on its own!

ML:
ML is a part of AI where machines learn from data instead of directly told what to do.

GPT:
Generative Pretrained Transformer is an advanced AI model created by OpenAI. It's designed to understand and generate human-like text based on what you ask it or provide as input.

Spring AI is a concept that aims to simplify the integration of AI and ML models into Spring-based applications.

It provides abstractions and tools to interact with AI APIs like OpenAI,Hugging Face, or custom models deployed via REST endpoints.


It abstracts API calls to AI services,enabling developers to interact with models for:
    - Text Generation E.g.chatbots
    - Image Generation E.g. AI art
    - Classification and predictions E.g. recommendation systems
    - Custom tasks based on ML models.

Key Terminologies:
    - Prompt
        A prompt is the input text or query you provide to the AI model to generate text. Crafting a good prompt ensures relevant,accurate, and contextual responses.

    - Token
        The smallest unit of text the model processes. Tokens can be words, characters, or sub-words.
    
    - Max Tokens   
        The maximum number of tokens allowed in the output.

    - Temperature
        Controls the randomness of the output.
        = Lower values(e.g. 0.2): Output is more deterministic and focused.
        = Higher values(e.g. 0.8): Output is more creative and diverse.

    - model 
        - The specific AI model used for generation. Examples:
            - text-davinci-003(GPT-3.5):High quality,versatile.
            - gpt-4 : Advanced reasoning and larger contexts.
